# Status

## Strawberry Gap Closure

- [x] Add smart-history recall in the Rust backend and expose it to the runtime UI.
- [x] Add scheduled Agent App workflows with persistence and a background runner.
- [x] Add a concurrent-runs surface in the Copilot UI for multiple active/recent runs.
- [x] Update validation and AI/docs metadata for the new workflow surface.
- [x] Run the full relevant Rust and frontend test suites.

## Current Status

- Strawberry parity work is implemented and committed.
- Automated validation is green across Rust, the runtime frontend, and the Playwright UI lane.
- Remaining follow-up is manual smoke from `VALIDATE.md`.
- The Tauri/Vite dev stack has been cold-restarted after clearing build artifacts, and the fresh dev binary is running.
- `ipfs://` and `ipns://` navigation now resolves through the embedded browser node instead of rewriting through a public gateway.

## Active Task

- [x] Perform a clean restart of the Tauri/Vite dev stack so updated permissions and runtime UI state are loaded from a fresh process.
- [x] Make the browser resolve `ipfs://` and `ipns://` URLs internally instead of rewriting them to centralized HTTP gateways.
